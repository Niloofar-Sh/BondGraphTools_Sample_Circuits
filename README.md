# BondGraphTools_Sample_Circuits

Electrical Samples: Three simple electrical circuits are encoded via BondGraphTools (a Python package) in Jupyter Notebook. The results are provided as well.

Fluid Mechanics Samples: The bond graph representation of a "Straight Tube" (vessel) along with a "Branching Vessel" is modelled in BGT . The simulations are also provided.
